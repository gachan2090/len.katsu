Nice to meet you! My name is Garlen, and this is an ongoing project to showcase my programming projects/data engineering portfolio 
utilizing React js. It will showcase:
- My resume
- Career timeline so far
- Milestone projects
- fun tidbits
- and more...

This will be my front page, encased in a dynamic UI and focused around human-centered UX design. My goal is to become a 
data engineer/data scientist, but my desire is to make data more easily accessible and empower others to make the 
correct decisions for their business needs. ðŸŒŸ
